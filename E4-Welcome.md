# Greetings

Hello there! Greetings! Happy new year to all you ladies and gents!

This is Darren, a young 25 year-old who recently finished his Masters Degree in Computer Science (ayye!) who now has plenty of time to take on the next step of his life: The mastery of oneself.

## What is the podcast about?

So a little brief on what this podcast is really about: This podcast is about me. Sounds vain, but really, it is all about me and how me, a young adventurer, discovers the world. I am enchanted by learning and growing, both of which I find surrounds my daily journey in life: whether it comes from books that I read, people I meet, stories I hear, experiences I go through... I try my best to soak it up, and I weave them into my being.

I love to learn. That's what this podcast is about. I love to learn, and I love to talk about what I learn because I love sharing what I know to people who are willing to listen, or are eager to learn.

Enough introduction with the podcast, let's start with a few questions.

## Why does the show start with Episode 4?

So you might be wondering why there are some missing episodes missing from my Anchor Podcast, and the simple answer to that is: I uploaded other episodes back then that had bad audio quality and didn't have the proper exposition to carry my thoughts concisely and coherently.

I've decided to write what I want to share, before I actually record myself, that way I get to improve the quality of the message I want to share.

## What can I expect?

I have various topics that I plan to write and talk about. I imagine my podcast to have two kinds of entries: The first type is what I call An Article: These are episodes that are well-prepared, with a well-defined problem or theme to discuss and have a pre-written key points I want to discuss.

The second type is what I call Exploration: These are episodes that don't necessarily have a direct theme or problem to talk about, but are instead recorded live and have no general direction. On the spot, I prompt myself with questions that I ask myself to see what I think, to truly uncover the truth about myself. These will be pre-recorded offline and edited, so as to give me some control over what I reveal about myself.

Again, this podcast is about me. Francis Bacon, the father of the scientific method, once said: "Reading makes a full man, writing an exact man, and discourse a ready man." This podcast deals with the last two phrases. I've read and consumed an average amount. Now is the time to synthesis what I've learnt and to find out who I am. One might say, it is time to find out who I will choose to become.

This podcast is about me. Its main purpose is to help me grow when it comes to writing and discourse. Its secondary purpose is to share the knowledge in a relevant and easily digestable format. If it proves useful to others, great. If not, then I have compiled the 21st century diary that [[I will leave to my children]].

## Welcome!

That's it for the intro to the podcast. This is the part where I introduce you to the gates of my residence. In my manor, I hope you find the estate fills you with a sense of security and safety. This is a place that grows fruits of peace.
